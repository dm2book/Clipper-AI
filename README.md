## Status

Pre-implementation. The system design is complete and under review; no
application code has been written yet.

- [System architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — data model, API, workers,
  upload path, processing pipeline, capacity model, and delivery phases.

## Reading order

Start with the [design principles](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#1-design-principles)
and [system overview](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#2-system-overview). They establish
the control-plane/data-plane split that the rest of the document depends on.

If you are picking up implementation work, the sections that constrain early
code most are the [database architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#3-database-architecture)
(tenancy and indexing decisions that are expensive to change later) and the
[worker architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#5-worker-architecture)
(idempotency and checkpointing requirements).
